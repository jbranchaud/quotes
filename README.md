> Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
> Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to

> computer to do.

-- Donald E. Knuth, [_Literate Programming_](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf)

> The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them
> quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly.

-- Donald E. Knuth, [_Selected Papers on Computer Science_](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/cs.html)

> Programming ought to be regarded as the art of telling another human being
> what one wants the computer to do.
