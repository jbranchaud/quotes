> The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are
> chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound
> one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two
> ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one
> another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into
> one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is
> separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real
> existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are
> made.

-- John Locke, [_An Essay Concerning Human Understanding_](http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/locke1690book2.pdf)
