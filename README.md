> Programming ought to be regarded as the art of telling another human being

-- Micheal L. Scott, _Programming Language Pragmatics_

> Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
> Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to
> do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a
> computer to do.

-- Donald E. Knuth, [_Literate Programming_](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf)
