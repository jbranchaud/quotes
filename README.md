> For any way of thought to become dominant, a conceptual apparatus has to

> But what you learn, as you get older, is that there are a few billion

-- Neal Stephenson, [_The Diamond Age_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age)

> It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data abstraction than 10

-- Rich Hickey, quoted in _The Joy Of Clojure_, Ch. 5

> Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
> Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to
> do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a
> computer to do.

> The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them
> quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly.

-- Donald E. Knuth, [_Selected Papers on Computer Science_](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/cs.html)

> Programming ought to be regarded as the art of telling another human being
> what one wants the computer to do.

-- Micheal L. Scott, [_Programming Language Pragmatics_](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/pragmatics/)

> The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are
> chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound
> one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two
> ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one
> another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into
> one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is
> separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real
> existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are
> made.
